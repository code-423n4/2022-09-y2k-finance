Hello Y2K team. In the https://www.y2k.finance/mint page, while selecting assets, the assets are not getting loaded. It is showing , Loading ..... for a very long time. I have tried it yesterday also.

We deployed it on testnet a few days ago but we already closed the testing epoch. As such, the website is not supposed to have any onchain functionality until our actual launch. Please bear in mind that we specifically submitted our repo for auditing, not the website itself.

both Vaults(hedge and risk) will swap their total assets with the other party.


[09/15/2022 1:19 AM] ladboy233
what does that mean?


[09/15/2022 4:16 AM] mathewthomas_
Thank you very much. I have just mentioned it just to let you know, in case. I know that at this point of time, the audit is specifically for the repo only.  Y2K finance is a very good project with amazing potential.Have a good day.


[09/15/2022 9:43 AM] MiguelBits#2642
The WETH inside each vault will be tranfered to the other one. Risk will send the underlying WETH of that epoch to the Hedge vault, and vice versa


[09/15/2022 2:55 PM] rustyrabbit
is 'oracles/PegOracle.sol' in scope or not ? It only seems to be used from the tests.


[09/15/2022 3:09 PM] rustyrabbit
I presume it's deployed and then used as any other Chainlink oracle ?

@MiguelBits


[09/15/2022 3:55 PM] MiguelBits#2642
Yes


[09/15/2022 3:55 PM] MiguelBits#2642
And yes 🙂


[09/15/2022 4:09 PM] praneshasp
hi guys, found the issue with the `testOwnerAuthorize()` (one of the failing test cases) .. should I submit this as a QA report? (this is my first submission btw... )


[09/15/2022 4:11 PM] nexusflip
Check the readme on the repo, everything about failing tests is detailed there


[09/15/2022 4:12 PM] praneshasp
Found this comment: `  //@dev: please assess this case and check if contract logic fault or test logic fault` in the Assert.t.sol


[09/15/2022 4:12 PM] praneshasp
is it for the wardens or for the internal team?


[09/15/2022 4:13 PM] praneshasp
its both test and logic fault


[09/15/2022 4:13 PM] nexusflip
For wardens, please check README.md, specifically the "Tests" and "Concerns & Additional Information" tabs


[09/15/2022 4:14 PM] nexusflip
If you have a possible solution for this problem submit a report and we will review it


[09/15/2022 4:14 PM] nexusflip
Let me know if I can be of any additional assistance


[09/15/2022 4:14 PM] praneshasp
sure will do.. thanks!!

[09/15/2022 11:16 PM] dravee
It became pretty standard, even on the other running contest. I agree it should've been put *after* the files in Scope though, and that slocs might be more confusing than useful. Thanks for the feedback 👍


[09/16/2022 12:52 AM] rotcivegaf
could someone run the tests or compile?


[09/16/2022 2:00 AM] nexusflip
Please refer to the "Tests" tab in the readme for additional information on how to run tests. For compiling, you need the Foundry libraries preinstalled (refer to Foundry book at https://book.getfoundry.sh/ for a quick guide on how to set it up, afterwards just use the "forge build" command on the terminal)

[09/16/2022 10:20 AM] scaraven
Hi, I can't quite make sense of this paragraph here in the docs. Does that mean that if a depeg event occurs or an epoch ends then user fees are calculated before swapping funds between vaults? Does the protocol take a fee from the funds which belonged to the other vault and if so how does it do this?

[09/16/2022 12:04 PM] MiguelBits#2642
Fees are taken on your withdraw of assets


[09/16/2022 12:06 PM] MiguelBits#2642
Which happens after swapping tokens


[09/16/2022 1:08 PM] scaraven
thx


[09/16/2022 3:45 PM] anonnp
What is the idea behind `timewindow` in `Vault.sol`


[09/16/2022 4:35 PM] MiguelBits#2642
It is the timewindown between the start of insurance epoch


[09/16/2022 4:35 PM] MiguelBits#2642
And the last day allowed to deposit

Hi all! I'm trying to better understand when and how the `PegOracle` is used. It looks like the oracle passed in `VaultFactory#createNewMarket` is either an unwrapped Chainlink TOKEN/USD price feed or a wrapped `PegOracle` feed depending on the pair, is that right? If so, are there other token/token pairs besides stETH/ETH you intend to support? (for example, other stable/stable pairs like FRAX/USDC, USDT/DAI, etc.)
